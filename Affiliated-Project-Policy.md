# OBF Affiliated Project Status Policy (Unratified Draft) 

_Status: This policy is currently being developed. It has not been discussed beyond the Board of Directors yet._

## Background

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) is a non-profit, volunteer-run
group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source
software development and Open Science within the biological research community.

OBF originally grew out of the volunteer projects BioPerl, BioJava
and Biopython. Later BioRuby, BioSQL, BioLib, DAS, MOBY, EMBOSS, and
OBDA joined the OBF umbrella, primarily as a consequence of requiring
project hosting support, existing community relationships, and through
informal consensus among members of OBF's Board of Directors. OBF
has since become hesitant to include new projects under the official
umbrella, in part because the growth in OBF-hosted project resources
has reached the capacity of OBF servers, and in part because of
OBF's mission and scope as an organization. Furthermore, the
[existing listing of projects related to OBF](http://www.open-bio.org/w/index.php?title=Projects&oldid=4609)
in different ways uses affiliation categories that are based neither
on a formal definition nor on a community process for attaining them,
and are thus poorly aligned with OBF values of community and
transparency.

## Motivation

This policy aims to formalize criteria and a community-driven,
transparent process by which open-source software projects can gain,
lose, and maintain certain types of affiliation with the OBF.

Establishing an affiliation between an open source software project and OBF has value for both the
project and the OBF. It can raise a project's profile and public standing, which in turn can allow it to attract more attention from users as well as potential volunteers, and can thus promote a project's overall health. Promoting the health and sustainability of bioinformatics open-source software projects is among
the OBF's primary objectives. In addition, 
the user and developer communities of affiliated projects constitute the primary pool of volunteers for OBF as an organization and an umbrella effort.

That notwithstanding, the OBF has not, and does not intend to serve
primarily as a project hosting provider for bioinformatics open-source
projects. Instead, as a project umbrella the OBF's focus is on
projects that serve, or have the potential to serve, a large variety
of bioinformatics research applications and users. Therefore, the
group of projects with some status of affiliation with the OBF is
expected to always be limited in number. In keeping with the potential benefits of affiliation for a project, the criteria formalized here aim to maintain OBF's historical focus.

Projects differ in terms of their activity, community, audience, and
wider impact on bioinformatics. Also, over time, projects change, become
more active, or less relevant and even dormant. This policy aims to provide mechanisms through which projects' affiliations can reflect such dynamics.

## Project affiliation status types

### Core OBF Project

Core OBF projects are long standing bioinformatics open-source initiatives with an active developer
community and an established sizable bioinformatics user base. Among other things, these projects will typically be marked by a community culture welcoming newcomers, and an informative, up-to-date, and inviting web presence. They will also be active members of the OBF organization. 

Among the projects with an existing OBF affiliation status, representative examples are BioPerl and Biopython.

### Affiliated OBF Project

Affiliated OBF projects are active bioinformatics open-source initiatives with an
active developer community, but a limited or small user base. Such projects may have a narrow focus, or be in the early phases of adoption. Even if small by comparison to Core OBF Projects, their developer and user communities will nevertheless be very active, and their focus will be highly relevant to the OBF. These projects will also be active members of
the OBF organization.

### Candidate OBF Project

Candidate OBF Projects have the aspiration and promise to
develop themselves into an Affiliated OBF Project. They may already meet most or all criteria for Affiliated Project status except for having been active members of the OBF organization. 

This status presents the path for projects previously unaffiliated with the OBF to attain official affiliation. Candidate Projects will be in this status for only a limited amount of time, typically one year, and no more than 3 years in a row.

### Other projects

Projects other than those under the stated affiliation categories may
have a de-facto relationship with OBF or one of its official member
projects, but they do not have a recognized affiliation status. As
such, their status is not voted on.

These projects may include student projects with OBF community
participation, including projects executed under the OBF umbrella,
and other projects considered active and interesting to the wider
bioinformatics community. They may be listed and described on the
OBF wiki so long as it is evident that they do not have an official
affiliation with the OBF as per the ones defined here.
 
## Community voting on project status

Projects can change or attain an affiliation status once a year by a vote of the OBF community. 

The OBF community for the purposes of this policy may be represented by, but need not be limited to the OBF membership. For example, the collective attendees of a BOSC conference, or of similar OBF-endorsed events, also qualify representative of the OBF community. Voting may be by electronic means, or simply by physical signs such as raising hands. The exact details of voting are intentionally left to the OBF volunteers organizing the process in a given year so long as the process is reasonably consistent between subsequent years.

### Ballot preparation

A group of OBF members overseeing the ballot preparation for the annual OBF community vote will conduct the following steps at least 14 days before voting is scheduled to take place:

* Identify currently affiliated projects that desire or may warrant a status change.
* Identify previously unaffiliated projects that desire OBF affiliation.
* Solicit mission, scope, and metrics from project leads as suitable for each project to be voted on.
* Compile this information online, disseminate it to the OBF membership as well as the larger developer and user community, and solicit feedback from these communities.
* Incorporate feedback as suitable into the online documentation.

### Voting

A group of OBF members overseeing the voting process for the annual OBF community vote will in general conduct the following steps:

* Ensure that the OBF community to cast votes is aware of the projects on the ballot, and the argument(s) for or against the status changes that are on the ballot.
* Ensure an opportunity for each project on the ballot to present its viewpoint, not to exceed 5 minutes per project.
* Organize and execute the voting.

Projects that are on the ballot for being promoted to a certain status but fail to achieve the required majority will remain at their current status, with the exception of Candidate OBF Projects that have exhausted the maximum time a project can remain in Candidate status. Such projects will lose Candidate OBF Project status as a consequence of failing to attain Affiliated OBF Project status.

#### Core OBF Project status

To become a Core OBF Project a project has to have been an Affiliated OBF Project for at least
3 years. A Core OBF Project can also be voted to be demoted to Affiliated OBF Project status.

In either case a
majority of 70% is required.

#### Affiliated OBF Project

To become an Affiliated OBF Project a project has to have had Candidate OBF Project status for at least 1 year. An Affiliated OBF Project can also be voted
to be demoted to Candidate OBF Project status.

In either case a majority of 70% is required. 

#### Candidate OBF Project

A project not currently affiliated with OBF can attain Candidate OBF Project status for one year. For current Candidate OBF Projects their status can, by vote, be extended for another year if the project has not yet achieved the criteria required to attain Affiliated OBF Project status.

A majority of 70% is required.

## Maintenance of affiliation status

The affiliation status of Core OBF Projects and Affiliated OBF Projects that are not voted on remains the same for another year. Candidate OBF Projects will lose this status when they have exhausted the maximum time Candidate status can be held and have not been voted into Affiliated OBF Project status. 

## Dispute and Board Veto

Any dispute on votes or current affiliation status of a project must
be brought before the OBF Board of Directors, who will arbitrate, if
necessary by public meeting and vote. The Board's decision is final
and binding.

The OBF Board of Directors may, at its discretion, veto, instate, or
terminate a project's official affiliation status, if the Board determines
the need to do so. It is expected that the Board will do so in public
session, whether at an annual Board meeting, or at a specifically
convened one.
