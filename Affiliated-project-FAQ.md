# Affiliated and core project FAQ

## Q: How do I apply for Affiliated Project status?

Assuming your project meets, or intends to soon meet, all of the requirements in
 our [affiliated project policy](obf-docs/Affiliated-Project-Policy.md), please
 email [SOME EMAIL ADDRESS] with the following details:

- URL of the project
- Contact information for the project maintainers
- Proof of compliance with Affiliate Status requirements where possible, e.g.
licence, code of conduct, etc. or plan to implement any missing requirements.

You can also feel free to drop us a line if you have questions about your
eligibility before applying.

## Q: Why apply for affiliate status? Are there benefits or obligations?

A: The **benefits** of affiliate status primarily provides you with umbrella
resources, including a community of active open source developers, the chance to
 mentor summer students under the Google Summer of Code program, and domain /
 site hosting resources.

 The **obligations** of affiliate status are few - primarily projects must
 remain active and maintain a good standing within the community, e.g. by
 enforcing their code of conduct if necessary.

## Q: Can I sign my project over to the OBF's ownership?

A: The OBF is primarily a home for projects that are actively maintained. If
you fear your project doesn't have enough community contributors we can share
a call for contributors within the OBF community, but the OBF does not provide
software maintenance services.
  
## Q: I'm interested in taking donations for my project, or I've recently received a grant. Can the OBF handle my cash flow?

A: The OBF does not provide financial management for its member projects. You
could try to apply for financial hosting / sponsorship with organisations such
[SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/), [NumFocus](https://www.numfocus.org/), or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/)
