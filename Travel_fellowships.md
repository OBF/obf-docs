# Open Bioinformatics Foundation Event Fellowships

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation ([OBF](https://www.open-bio.org)) promotes open source bioinformatics software development and open science in the biological research community. 
The OBF Event Fellowship program is aimed at increasing diverse participation at events promoting open science practices such as open source software and resource development in the bioinformatics and biological research community.

These fellowships are available to support both in-person and remote (virtual) participation at events such as conferences, workshops, training courses or collaborative development sprints.

## Application deadlines

There are two rounds of applications with the following **application deadlines**:

- Round-1: 1 April
- Round-2: 1 October

The calls for applications are announced through a [blog post on the website](https://www.open-bio.org/blog/), [official mailing list](https://mailman.open-bio.org/mailman/listinfo/open-bio-announce) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/obf_news).

## Application form

The applications are submitted for each round via [this application form](https://forms.gle/evzK6wBN8XtnGLUMA).

We have created [a word template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tgzkHS84L8m3RwYoL7X86Axb6p_OiqNWaoJpiV4q8S0/edit?usp=sharing) of the form, which can be used for creating a draft of your application. 
Please make a copy or download this document as a '.docx' file.

If Google Docs and Forms are not accessible from your geographical location, please email the fellowship chair to receive a template document by email.

Applicants will be asked to supply the following information:

### Personal information

Applicants are asked to provide personal information such as name, email address, career stage, and affiliation.
This information will not be shared with the review panel but will be used by the fellowship chair to identify who the applicants are.

### Event and nature of participation

In this part, applicants will be expected to provide information about the event they have selected to participate in.
Requested details include the name of the event, event website, dates (should take places within 1 year from the application deadline), type of the event (conference, training, or other), confirmation if the event is taking place in-person or online. 
Applicants should also describe the nature of their participation (presenter, attendee or other) and how it relates to open science practices or open source software. 

OBF Event Fellowships are intended to enable awardees to participate in events that promote open source bioinformatics and/or open science. 
We ask applicants to describe (maximum 250 words) how this event and their participation in it relate to these goals.

### Open Source Resources

OBF promotes the development of open-source bioinformatics software, documentation, or other content useful for research communities. 
In this section, applicants are asked to provide a link to a repository to which they have contributed and evidence of open-source licensing.

They are further expected to describe the project that their participation in the event involves (either because they are presenting, co-developing, or because the event involves activities around this topic).
If they cannot provide links to specific resources and licenses, then they can describe how their participation furthers open science practices.

### Promoting diversity and representation

One of the goals of the OBF fellowship is to increase participation from groups otherwise underrepresented at the event or in the broader community, including but not limited to underrepresented country of residence or origin, ethnic background (historically underrepresented and other minority groups), career stages, sexuality, gender identity and expression, and people with disabilities.

We ask applicants to describe how their participation in this event helps increase diversity and representation of any marginalised and traditionally underrepresented group in the _overall_ open source bioinformatics and/or open science community.

Note that applicants may have an answer to this question even if they are not personally a member of an underrepresented group. 
This section is important for the evaluation of their application.

### Justification for funding

The OBF Event Fellowships are available for the awardees to cover conference registration fees and other participation related costs of up to USD $1,000. 

Applicants are asked to provide details of expenses they hope to be reimbursed through the OBF Event fellowship. 
Here, they can provide as much detail as possible to help the review panel make a fair recommendation for the fellowship awardees.

Please see the next section for more details.

## What does the event fellowship cover?

The OBF Event Fellowships are available for the awardees to cover conference registration fees and other participation related costs of up to USD $1,000. 

### Items covered for in-person participation

The fellowship can be used to cover conference registration fees and direct travel costs (such as airfare, train, metro, bus and taxi), hotel, and/or child-care up to a value of USD 1,000. 
Note that rental car expenses and personal car mileage are not eligible for reimbursement. 
If the applicants anticipate that they would require more than USD 1,000 in order to attend the event, they should include that information in the application form.
Please note that requests made for more than $1000 may not be granted if not clearly justified by the applicants.

### Items covered for remote participation

The fellowship can be used to cover conference registration fees and the costs of small hardware (such as microphone, speaker and webcam), childcare for the duration of the event and/or other supporting materials.

The cost of remote participation will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
For example, we are aware that due to the load-shedding issues in many developing countries, our applicants might need to pay for the fuel for the generator to keep their electricity running for the duration of the event.
Similarly, the cost of high-speed internet may vary across countries and may also be requested by applicants from many developing countries.

Applicants are eligible to apply for the cost of a communication platform only if they are hosting a virtual event and will require a paid subscription to access the necessary premium features of the software used in their event.
When applying for the cost of hardware, please note that this fellowship will not cover the cost of buying laptops and computers.
However, this fellowship may cover the rental cost of the large hardware (for example, second screen) required to attend or host a virtual event.
The cost will be capped to a maximum of $40 (USD) each for small hardware such as headphones, webcam, speaker, and/microphone.
If the cap is insufficient, applicants can describe their hardware needs in their application.

## Review process

### Role of the fellowship chair (and review timeline)

The fellowship chair will make sure that the call for applications is announced at least 6 weeks before the deadline by updating the application form for each round, drafting a blog post, coordinating with the newsletter chair and receiving approval from the OBF board members.

After the application period is over, they will coordinate with the OBF board members to invite volunteers to serve in the review panel and create all the required documents such as applications (assign alias and remove personal information) and reviewing form with rubrics to share with the panel.
In the first week after the deadline, the review panel will be asked to review all or selected applications (based on the number of applications for that round).

In the second week, the fellowship chair will create a summary of the scores and discuss it with the board members to identify the awardees for that round.

Preferably, by the beginning of the third week, the fellowship chair will inform the chosen awardees asking for confirmation regarding the fellowship acceptance and informing them of the process for getting reimbursed for their expense after they have participated in the event.
They will also inform the applicants who were not selected and provide feedback when requested.

Upon confirmation, a public blog post will be drafted by the fellowship chair informing the community of the current awardees.
Internally, they will also maintain communication with the awardees helping them publish their post-event blog post and sorting their reimbursement with the help of the OBF treasurer.

### Review panel

The review panel is drawn for every round of applications from the OBF Board members and volunteers based on their availability. 
Any panelist with a clear *conflict of interest*[1] will recuse themselves from deliberation. 

[1] A conflict of interest may occur despite the anonymization if the applicant is known to the reviewer via the project description or online repository.

### Selection criteria

The selection of the fellowship awardees is based on the criteria described below. 
We expect applicants to include sufficient information in their application to allow the review panel to assess their eligibility fairly.

***A rubric is currently under development, which will be added to this page upon approval from the OBF board members.***

#### Event and nature of participation

The review panel will assess how the event that the applicants have selected and the nature of their participation promote open science practices in bioinformatics and/or biological research community.

It's important to keep in mind that the event should be scheduled to occur anytime in a one-year window starting one month after the application deadline.

Events that are eligible may include but are not limited to conferences, workshops, code fests, hackathons, training courses, collaborative sprints, informal meet-ups or other skill-building and networking event. 
If an applicant intends to attend OBF events BOSC and/or the OBF CoFest and other events hosted by the member projects, their application may be given a slight preference.

The review panel will look at the nature of applicant's participation (their roles) at the event.
For example, they may be hosting the event, giving a talk, chairing a session, running a Birds of a Feather discussion, offering a training event, facilitating a sprint (or similar session), leading a project at a code fest/hackathon, presenting a poster, participating in a panel discussion, reviewing abstracts for the event, contributing to the event as a co-organiser, or volunteering to help the organisation committee during the event.

#### Open Source Resources

The review panel may look at applicant's general involvement in open source development (such as their GitHub contributions to the Open Source project) or open science communities (for example, their previous work advocating for open practices and diversity).

Any information regarding past participation in the project that they are representing will be useful for evaluating their application as well.
Therefore, please supply the link of the public repository or online resources that will help the panel in the review process.

This will not be a limiting factor if applicants are new to bioinformatics and open science and express their enthusiasm and willingness to practice open science principles learned from OBF community and other events of their choice.

#### Promoting diversity and representation

The review panel will look at how applicant's attendance will contribute to increasing diversity at the event.
We understand increasing diversity as increasing participation of members from groups traditionally underrepresented in the bioinformatics, computation or tech community or at the event.
This includes but is not limited to underrepresented demographic groups (members from many developing nations), ethnic origins, career stages, sexuality, gender identity and expression, and people with disabilities.

If applicants are not from a minority or underrepresented group but have a track record for advocating for diversity as an ally through their work or involvement in an event, they are welcome to apply for this fellowship as well.

*We do not consider the diversity of operating systems, programming languages or scientific domain as a criterion for the OBF Event Fellowship.*

## Announcement of the application outcome

Applicants will be notified of the outcome no later than 3 weeks after the application deadline.

Those who receive the fellowship award will be able to discuss any further details with the fellowship chair and/or the OBF board members.

Applicants who are unsuccessful in a round can request for feedback.
They will be able to apply again with a revised and updated application in the next round.

## Responsibilities of the fellowship awardees

We expect that applicant;s participation in the event will promote open science practices in software development, training, documentation, publication and collaborative efforts in the biological research community, and will ideally promote diversity in their communities. 

After the event, the awardees are required to write a blog post on the [OBF blog](https://www.open-bio.org/category/travel-fellowship/) about their experience attending the event and describing the main outcomes of their participation.

The fellowship chair will help create a WordPress account on the OBF website where they will provide editorial support for publishing the blog post. 
Please note that this should be completed within three weeks after the event ends, and is a prerequisite before the awardee can receive payment.

Meanwhile, the awardees will be put in touch with the OBF treasurer who will share the reimbursement form and help sort out the expenses as per the guidelines shared with them.

If due to any reason, the awardee's circumstances change and they can no longer attend the said event or accept the fellowship award, they should discuss the details with the fellowship chair and/or the board members.

## Reimbursement

The OBF will reimburse the recipient after the event based on receipts provided, proof of attendance has been submitted to the OBF treasurer, and the blog post about the event has been published.
There is no cash value beyond eligible and documented expenses. 
All reimbursement claims must be filed (and all prerequisites for receiving payment must be met, see below) within 3 months after the conclusion of the event, after which the fellowship award expires.

We will ask the fellowship awardess to the state for our records that none of their claimed expenses have been or will be reimbursed from another source (for example, their employer, or other grants).
