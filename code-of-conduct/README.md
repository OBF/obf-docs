# The Open Bioinformatics Foundation: Code of Conduct

> A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the norms, rules, and responsibilities or proper practices of an individual party or an organisation. (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct))

[Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://www.open-bio.org/) is committed to providing a harassment-free and respectful environment for all members of our community. The Code of Conduct documents describe norms, rules, and recommended practices for all our participants and members. Particularly, we want to make sure that we create a welcoming and supportive community for everyone, provide clear guidelines of reporting incidents and describe how their reports will be handled.

## About these documents

This document is adapted from guidelines written by the [Django Project](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/enforcement-manual/), which was itself based on the [Ada Initiative](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports) template and the [PyCon 2013 Procedure for Handling Harassment Incidents](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/harassment-incidents/). Contributors to that document: Adam Obeng, Aleksandra Pawlik, Bill Mills, Carol Willing, Erin Becker, Hilmar Lapp, Kara Woo, Karin Lagesen, Pauline Barmby, Sheila Miguez, Simon Waldman, Tracy Teal, Malvika Sharan, Kari L. Jordan, Samantha Ahern. Additional language was added by [Otter Tech](https://otter.technology) from the [PyCon U.S. 2018 Code of Conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2018/about/code-of-conduct/) ([licensed CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)). 

In 2018, the Code of Conduct was revised to add a summary, straightforward examples of both beneficial and unwanted behaviors, and evaluating intent. Reporting guidelines were also revised to include alternate contact points and a reporting form with the procedure was added. In 2019, an appeal process, the procedure for following up with a reportee, terminology, Code of Conduct incident response procedure, termed suspension checklist, expanded clauses for conflicts of interest, and committee membership agreement were included. Contributors of these revised documents are Ethan White, Kari L. Jordan, Karin Lagesen, Malvika Sharan, Samantha Ahern, and Simon Waldman.

OBF-specific modifications were added by Malvika Sharan, Yo Yehudi, Bastian Greshake Tzovaras.
