## Financial asset transfer

As of April 1, 2013, OBF does not maintain its own bank accounts anymore. All of OBF's financial assets have been transferred to, and are now managed by Software in the Public Interest ([SPI]), a fiscal sponsorship organization for open-source projects with which OBF became an associated project in October 2012.

The balance transferred (and thus the starting balance at SPI) was $37,386.45. The biows.* domain name costs and Raoul B.'s 2012 GSoC Summit travel costs (see below) were reimbursed prior to transfer.

## Income

| Item                                        |Date(s)|   Amount  |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-----:|----------:|
| Donation (for biows.* domain names)         |  4/20 |    $60.86 | 
| Donation (for biows.* domain names)         |  4/29 |   $121.36 | 
| Donation (for 2012 BOSC Travel Fellowships) |  9/18 | $1,000.00 | 
| Donation (for 2013 BOSC Travel Fellowships) |  9/18 | $1,000.00 | 

Total income: **$2,182.22**

Total income earmarked for FY 2013 programmatic activities: $1,182.22

## Expenses

Note: expenses incurred (and reimbursed) before transferring our assets to SPI are not individually called out here. Also, this does not include expenses incurred on behalf of OBF but not yet reimbursed.

| Item                                        |Date(s)|   Amount  |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-----:|----------:|
| biows.* domain names (reimb. to HilmarL)    |  3/15 |    $60.86 | 
| 2012 GSoC summit Raoul B. (reimb. to ChrisD)|  3/15 | $1,051.11 | 
| Processing fees for donations/expenses      |       |    $83.48 |
| Accounting discrepancy(*)                   |       |    $16.07 |
|---------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|
| SPI 5% fees                                 |       |   $103.04 | 

The 2012 GSoC summit travel expenses for Raoul B. were incurred, and paid by ChrisD in FY 2012, but reimbursed to ChrisD only in 2013.

(*) The accounting of expenses was based on a report obtained from
SPI. The ending balance for OBF-earmarked funds held at SPI on that
report was $16.07 higher than the ending balance of OBF-earmarked
funds shown on the SPI Treasurer Report for Nov 1 to Nov 30, 2013. The
discrepancy is likely due to an error in the summarization of SPI fees
paid during OBF's FY 2013, and is therefore accounted for here as fees.

Totals for FY 2013:
+ Total programmatic expenses paid:            $1,195.45
+ Total expenses:                              $1,314.56
