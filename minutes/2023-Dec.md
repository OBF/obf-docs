## Old business

- Approved by unanimous consent (including prior approval of the PR by Hilya, the one Board member who was not able to attend this meeting). Merged.

## Review and approve minor changes to bylaws
- Pull Request: [https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/pull/102](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/pull/102)
  - Remove one instance of gendered language, replacing “her” with “their”
  - Change title of “Secretary” of Board to “Vice President” (with duties unchanged beyond standing in for the President when necessary)
- Approved by unanimous consent of the 8 Board members present. Merged.

## Board elections
- Hilmar says serving as a member of the OBF Board has been an honour, and hopes to continue, although not in a leadership position
- Peter says it’s also been an honour to take up the President role, happy to continue with the board’s support,
  and hoping he will have more time to contribute in the near future.
  He would be happy to facilitate a transfer to a new post holder for an orderly transfer at the end of his next term if someone else wanted to run for the office and is elected.
  Peter noted that all the current board members are eligible to run for President next time elections are held.
- Heather: echoing what has been said, honoured to have served as board member at large and now as treasurer.
- Voting
  - The eight attending members of the current Board voted via (Helios)[https://vote.heliosvoting.org/] electronic ballot
  - For some reason, Helios took a while to tally the results, but it eventually did so (after the meeting had ended).
