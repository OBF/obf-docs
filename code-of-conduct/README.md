# The Open Bioinformatics Foundation: Code of Conduct

> A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the norms, rules, and responsibilities or proper practices of an individual party or an organisation. (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct))

[Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://www.open-bio.org/) is committed to providing a harassment-free and respectful environment for all members of our community. The Code of Conduct documents describe norms, rules, and recommended practices for all our participants and members. Particularly, we want to make sure that we create a welcoming and supportive community for everyone, provide clear guidelines of reporting incidents and describe how their reports will be handled.

## About these documents

This document is adapted from guidelines written for [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html), which was expanded from [Django Project](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/enforcement-manual/) originally based on the [Ada Initiative](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports) template and the [PyCon 2013 Procedure for Handling Harassment Incidents](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/harassment-incidents/). Contributors to the reference documents are: Adam Obeng, Aleksandra Pawlik, Bill Mills, Carol Willing, Erin Becker, Hilmar Lapp, Kara Woo, Karin Lagesen, Pauline Barmby, Sheila Miguez, Simon Waldman, Tracy Teal, Malvika Sharan, Kari L. Jordan, Samantha Ahern. Additional language was added by [Otter Tech](https://otter.technology) from the [PyCon U.S. 2018 Code of Conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2018/about/code-of-conduct/) ([licensed CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)). 
In 2018 and 2019, The Carpentries Code of Conduct was revised to add a summary, straightforward examples of both beneficial and unwanted behaviors, evaluating intent, reporting guidelines, an appeal process, the procedure for following up with a reportee, terminology, Code of Conduct incident response procedure, termed suspension checklist, expanded clauses for conflicts of interest, and committee membership agreement -- all of which have been adopted by the OBF Code of Conduct. Contributors of these revised documents are Ethan White, Kari L. Jordan, Karin Lagesen, Malvika Sharan, Samantha Ahern, and Simon Waldman.

OBF-specific modifications were added by Malvika Sharan, Yo Yehudi, Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, and Code of Conduct specific emails were created by Hilmar Lapp.
